## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

*   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
*   npm (which comes with Node.js)
*   A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account to host your database.

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bikepoint-fullstack-app.git
    cd bikepoint-fullstack-app
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install the necessary dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root directory. This file will hold your secret database connection string.
    *   Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string to the `.env` file. It should look like this:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster...
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:5000`. You should see a "MongoDB Connected..." message in the terminal.

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    *   Open a **new terminal window**.
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install the necessary dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The frontend application will now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
